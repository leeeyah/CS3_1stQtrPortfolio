**Take on SONA July 2025 of Pres. Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr.**
**by Eiliyah Chryselle M. Beltran from 9-Beryllium.**

KEY POINTS I FOUND INTERESTING
- The ₱20 rice program to be launched nationwide through Kadiwa centers.
- Kindey transplants are now fully covered by PhilHealth.
- 12,000 public schools will finally get internet access.

KEY POINTS I FOUND WEIRD
- Tying government budgets strictly to "national goals".

REFLECTION
    To be honest, this year's SONA was memorable. Some parts make me think, "Oh, this could actually affect my family". When they mentioned the ₱20 rice program and kidney transplants, I was glad since this would be extremely helpful towards the people who are in need. For once, I thought maybe BBM is actually a really great president.

    However, there's no guarantee that these will actually happen. I've heard plenty of empty promised before. Still, I am hopeful that he keeps his word and actually implements these. I think that this SONA was better that the previous ones and I pray that our president's actions matches his words.
